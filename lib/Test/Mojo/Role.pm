=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Test::Mojo::Role> is not a real module, just documentation.
Roles do not inherit from a base, but if they did, this would be the base class for C<Test::Mojo::Role::>s.

Roles should be built in such a way that they can be applied via L<Role::Tiny>.
Roles may actually be applied using L<Test::Mojo::WithRoles> which provides a nice interface to the test author.
Your role does not need to depend on L<Test::Mojo::WithRoles> but if it does, the test author will get that module during install.
